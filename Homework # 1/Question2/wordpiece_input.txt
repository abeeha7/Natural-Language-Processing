Word piece models start with individual characters and then merge the most frequent pairs of characters.
For example, starting with "hello", you might first merge "h" and "e" to form "he", then "l" and "l" to form "ll", and so on.
The process continues until the desired vocabulary size is reached.
In this assignment, you will identify the first 10 pairs that a word piece algorithm would merge from the given text.
